## Hydra Experience

I really like using Hydra. I prefer Estuary just because I like the music aspect more, but I'm sure once I learn more on how to do visuals I'll like it just as much. My biggest struggle was trying to come up with code myself and know what it actually does because it's so new to me and I'm still trying to grapple the basics. So I would use the randomized button a couple times to riff off of others codes, or I would use codes on one of the pages that were linked to use last week. I think Hydra can be really fun when you know what you're doing, which is maybe why sometimes it was frustrating to me hahah I do like Hydra more than p5js though. p5js just feels like you need to do more work to get what you want to see on the screen. Not that I don't like doing work, but I don't always have the patience to wait longer than 2 minutes to see what I'm trying to create visually, if that makes sense. That's a point on hydras scale to me, because it like the almost instant gratification it gives me. I know both hydra and p5js make art, but hydra I think falls more under the category of the traditional definition of the word. I also just really like the kalidescope affect, I've always liked those types of things ever since I was younger.

Here's two screen shots of what I made.

![hydra.png]({{site.baseurl}}/hydra.png)
![hydra2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/hydra2.png)

The purpleish pink one is the one where I inputted a picture of my and my dog in the kalidescope. I think you can just see my dog in there lol I liked inputting your own screen it added an extra layer on how you can use hydra.

The second one was a code I got off the randomizer, but I messed around with the code, deleting things, adding things, changing numbers, and it gave me that. I thought it was really wild because the origianl image had a much small kalidescope and was not staticy (is that a word?? is that how you spell it if it is??) at all around the edges.
