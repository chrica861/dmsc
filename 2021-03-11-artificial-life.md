## Artificial Life

I was wondering if a game like The Sims would count as artificial life. Is that the same as life simulation games, or is there a difference? And I don't so much as mean the newer versions of the games, but the first two rounds of Sims base play where the sims you aren't playing live out their own lives. I guess as a more explicit example, over a decade ago (that was weird for me to say it does not feel that long ago), my sister had a huge sim family in The Sims 2. For a few days, she would play one side of the family, and then the next few days she would play different characters in the same family, and so on and so forth. One day she went back to play with a family she hadn't in a while to find it in disrepair. Apparently the female sim had an affair with a townie (a premade sim that came with the game) whom the character had been friends with, and the husband had found out and it was all just terrible bad and my sister was annoyed. She had assumed that nothing in this family would change when she left them, as time and date stay the same from the last time you played with them, but somehow these sims had gotten up to a lot during her time gone. Now I understand that a majority of The Sims isn't emergence, because the player does have significant control over the characters. My understanding of emergence is that previous interactions affect the future outcome of the game while still following a set of rules. So because of the past relationship the female character had with the townie, would the romantic relationship be considered the emergence? I hope this makes sense. I had a hard time grasping what emergence meant in the Introduction chapter we had to read and had to do research elsewhere.

I made a worm. I got the array down. I wasn't entirely sure has to incorporate the force in to the scene. Like I understood the code and where to put it and how it worked with the bouncy balls, but not exactly if it was working with my creatures, or how exactly it was working. I would assume if I saw how exactly it was working I would be able to see the emergence more clearly. The emergence would be the worms following the rules of the force, and how they interact with their surroundings based off of that code? Anyways, here's some screenshots and the code.
