## TidalWaves Practice

Honestly, coding has never been more fun to me. What I like particularly about coding music is the result happens instantly. Like in coding with p5.js you have to have several different parts for your creature/art/whatever to work exactly as you imagine it. There's such a simplicity with coding music because within seconds you can create this great music piece. Not to say I don't like coding visuals, watching those come to life is just as satisfying, but I enjoy the simplicity with TidalWaves. I was in a large group - Griffin, Monty, Kasey, Jacob and Ishan, so it was interesting to see exactly the different types of beats of effects the others were choosing. I particularly liked the water sound somebody there was using, it felt very calming for me. I also just loved to hear how the music changed as someone adjusted of changed their code completely. It was genuinely a lot of fun, and I never expected that I would ever understand how to code music, but here we are now!

## Here's some screenshots of the codes
