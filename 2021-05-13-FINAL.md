## FINAL

This project was really something. I knew from the beginning I wanted to draw clouds and use that in some way, shape, or form. I also knew I wanted it to where when two clouds interracted, one of the clouds turned into a entirely new cloud. I originally only drew four clouds to work with, so I wouldn't make this too confusing for myself in the start. I spent a lot of time in the beginning on working with states and a time mechanism so that after about 5 seconds or something, the cloud reverted back to it's original form. None of that ended up being in the final version.

I ended up creating classes for each cloud and spent hours, and I mean hours, watching videos and trying out different methods of collision to make the image change. I had a few attempts that were okay, but none of them were doing exactly what I wanted it to do. I started working with the if image collided img[2]=img[3] and so on, but again that wasn't working exactly as it should have. And then you sent me your solution in which you had the variable in the contructor, and I was able to siccessfully link all of the images to one another that way.

I started with wanting to create, not an ecosystem, but I can't think of the correct word so I'm just going to keep on using it, where the clouds coexisted, but were in a constant change of object when interracting with one specific cloud, which ended up being what I titled the "happy cloud". I wanted to create something fun and simple, but also complex enough for me where I would learn something new out of coding this, which ended up happening. I feel like my biggest problem with coding is I know what I want it to do, but I don't always know the correct piece of code to write or where exactly to put it. That's some of the reasons I received so many errors while doing this piece, but I was able to successfully overcome those.

My one still issue is the checked edges. Any one I tried, whether from a piece of my old code or when I was looking back on ones taught in class, none of them worked. I think I ended up deleting that section from most of the classes because it frustrated me to even look at. I always meant to go back to try and figure it out, but I didn't really have a chance to before our final class.
