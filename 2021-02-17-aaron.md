Theoretically, I think the tool I would love to exist and use would be something that could see the image you picture inside your head, and then draw that image for you. I just think a good amount of times, for better or for worse, not all of the design I work comes out as originally attended. Most times, that's fine. Other's, it's highly annoying that something just just a little off than I'd attended, and I end up not liking the piece at all and casting it aside for an unwarranted amount of time. A toddler once called me Chrica, and to most of my friends it just stuck and it's what they call me now, and I've sort of owned that nickname and made it my own. Not exaclty an alter ego, but just a part of me that is me, but also isn't. Anyways, that was a long story just to say I'd probably name it Chrica, as this too would be me, but also not me because it's my image, but the tool is doing the work.I guess just honing in on the details of whatever image is how I could end up collaborating with it. Like the tool can get the big picture, but need my help to get the small details - EX. Picture in my head is a tree, the tool can make the outline of the tree, but needs my help to get the shadows, cracks, etc. on the bark or the leaves.
