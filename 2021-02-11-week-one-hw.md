## LOGO


I thought Logo was really nice to use as a step back into coding after being away from it for a bit. At one point I accidentally did a repeat by the end of the frame, and so a design happened on either side, which ended up being a happy accident and something I tried a few different times (with varying degrees of success). Although it could be frustrating when it didn’t exactly listen, and I wasn’t sure if there was an option to undo a step, it was a really fun thing to use. I think my big difficulty with it at the moment is I have to really think about what direction to go instead of just entering something random. But I really want to try to create an actual simple image using Logo, I just have to figure out which one!

## Algorithmic Walk

**(I only go for walks with my dog, so the direction I walk + the random aspect typically depends on him lol)

For the walk, I have been taking this walk, or one similar to it, every day since last March, but this time just felt different. Like I never actually considered the direction I walk in, it’s usually a split-second decision. And I don’t think about crossing the street when I see another dog ahead of us either, it just comes naturally now, I suppose. It was just a very structured way of doing something that I’ve never given much thought to before. I didn’t really get the chance to try someone else’s walk, as it snowed on and off quite a bit and was typically too icy to really go anywhere farther than ten feet away from my apartment.

Also here's a picture of my dog! His name is Hercules and he will be eleven in May!!
