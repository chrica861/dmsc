# words

Using No Paint was a lot of fun! I really liked the randomness of it, because I never knew what I was going to get next. I feel like with my own work, I usually have a set plan from the start, and aside from a few minor changes, my piece stays the same from how I invisioned it at the start. With No Paint, maybe after a few paint clicks I would think, oh I want this to happen, or I hope this one comes up next. I know I could decide by editing the code, but I liked the random objects too much to do that. Because a part of having that random aspect ended up making the piece better than the route I'd originally wanted it to go! I feel like the randomness also just helped me to have a little fun, because in my own life I'm a little to anxious for a bunch of unplanned things to happen several times a day lol I definitely didn't feel like the artist of this piece perse though. It felt more like a collaboration, because the direction of the art wasn't my own, and also I didn't find these found objects or make the strokes of the brush itself.
