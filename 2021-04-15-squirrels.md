I think just in general group projects have been hard for me to do during the pandemic. I feel like I work better in person than over zoom or discord or whatever it is. Especially coding felt a little difficult, since with my past coding group projects we were able to just hand the keyboard back and forth. I have a bit of trouble as it is trying to find the correct place to put code, or how to write the code out correctly that if my group members hadn't compiled the code for me I would have gotten so lost. I also think the amount of time each of us has to work on the code was difficult. I had extremely less time than the others that I, admitedly, was only able to do the bare minimum. Meanwhile, Markus, Russel and especially so Chris were able to pick up all the extra things we had to do and they made the game look really cool. I'm extremely thankful they were my group members because they understood the code in no way I would have hahah I did show up to all of our meetings though and I tried to follow along as best as I could and help during the parts I did understand.

For the advanced category, we added the enemy squirrels bouncing against the bushes + trees, the eating sounds, creating an acorn and if you lose a life you can eat the acorn to regain a life and that continuously pops around during the game. We made a robot which the squirrel  gets to fight against and defeat once they get big enough. There's noise from the enemy squirrels. Also we did the decorative flowers, which we were confused by because we made it so it was similar to the grass, just with flowers, but we weren't sure if something else was made by that.
